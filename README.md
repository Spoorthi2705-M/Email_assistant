## Configuration

### 1. Enable IMAP in Gmail
1. Open Gmail ‚Üí Settings (‚öôÔ∏è) ‚Üí See all settings  
2. Go to **Forwarding and POP/IMAP** tab  
3. Enable **IMAP**  
4. Click **Save Changes**

### 2. Create a Gmail App Password
> Google no longer allows ‚Äúless secure apps‚Äù to access Gmail directly. You need an **App Password**.

1. Go to your Google Account ‚Üí Security  
2. Under **Signing in to Google**, select **App passwords**  
3. Select **Mail** as the app, and **Other (Custom name)** as device (e.g., `EmailBot`)  
4. Click **Generate** ‚Üí Copy the 16-character password  
5. Use this password in the Streamlit app **instead of your normal Gmail password**

### 3. Enter Credentials in Streamlit
- Open the Streamlit app ‚Üí Sidebar ‚Üí Enter:  
  - Your Gmail address  
  - The **App Password** you just generated  

**‚ö†Ô∏è Your credentials are never stored permanently.**

## **How It Works (High-Level Flow)**

The user logs in via the Streamlit interface using email + app password.
The system connects to Gmail via IMAP and fetches unread messages.
It checks for automated or spam emails to avoid reply loops.
The email body is extracted (text or HTML converted to text).
A transformer-based summarization model generates a concise summary.
A draft reply is composed, embedding the summary.
The system sends the reply using SMTP and marks the email as ‚ÄúSeen.‚Äù
The dashboard shows which emails were processed, with details and success status.


 ## **Usage Tips & Configuration**

Use Streamlit‚Äôs sidebar to set check interval (seconds) and max emails per check
Turn on auto-check for periodic inbox scans
Consider adding your own blacklist / whitelist rules in filters.py
If encountering errors with large emails, increase summary truncation or fallback to manual reading
